Introduction
It's just a copy of the virtual memory preferences app that comes with BeOS.  It works.

Documentation
Even tho it wasn't really necessary, I know I've overdocumented this app,  My excuse is that I wanted to learn how to use doxygen, and this was a good app to run it on.  So if you want full documentation, and you have doxygen installed, available from BeBits, run 
doxygen .doxygen-conf
in the code directory, and it will create docs for you
