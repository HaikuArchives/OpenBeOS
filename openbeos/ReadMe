Building
--------

The build system uses Jam/MR (http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html).
A BeOS executable of Jam 2.3.1 is available at:

  http://open-beos.sf.net/misc/jam.zip

Unzip the executable and copy it to /boot/home/config/bin.

To build the whole source tree, launch a Terminal, cd into the openbeos root
directory and just type:

  $ ./configure
  $ jam

The configure script generates a file named BuildConfig. As long as configure
is not modified (!), there is no need to call it again. That is for
re-building you only need to invoke Jam. If you don't update the source tree
very frequently, you may want to execute configure after each update just to
be on the safe side.

NOTE: If you have checked out the latest CVS version, it is not unlikely that
some parts of the tree won't build.


Running
-------

If the build went fine, a file named floppy.x86 had been created in the
root directory of the source tree. What you want to do now, is to boot from
this floppy image. Therefore you either write the image onto a real floppy
disk and restart you computer, or you write it onto a "virtual floppy disk"
emulated by a x86 PC emulator and just start this emulator.

1. Real Floppy

Put in the disk and type in the source tree's root dir:

  $ dd if=floppy.x86  of=/dev/disk/floppy/raw bs=18k


2. Emulated Floppy (Bochs)

Type:

  $ dd if=floppy.x86  of=<floppy image> bs=18k

where <floppy image> has to be replaced with the filename of the floppy
image Bochs has been told to use (e.g. /tmp/obos.img).


Bochs
-----

Version 1.4 of Bochs for BeOS (BeBochs) can be downloaded from BeBits:

  http://www.bebits.com/app/2902

The package installs to: /boot/apps/BeBochs1.4

You have to set up a configuration for Bochs. A relatively short and
painless procedure follows:

Lauch a Terminal:

  $ cd /tmp
  $ /boot/apps/BeBochs1.4/bximage

Answer with "fd", RETURN (for 1.44) and "obos.img", and a floppy image
/tmp/obos.img will be created.
Open folder /boot/apps/BeBochs1.4 and backup .bochsrc. Open .bochsrc with
your favorite text editor, remove the complete contents and paste the
following instead (you may as well take the original file and insert/replace/
keep the respective lines):

romimage: file=bios/BIOS-bochs-latest, address=0xf0000
megs: 32
vgaromimage: bios/VGABIOS-elpin-2.40
floppya: 1_44=/tmp/obos.img, status=inserted
boot: a
log: /var/log/bochs-obos.log
panic: action=ask
error: action=report
info: action=report
debug: action=ignore
vga_update_interval: 300000
keyboard_serial_delay: 250
keyboard_paste_delay: 100000
floppy_command_delay: 500
ips: 2000000

Now put the OBOS boot image onto you "virtual" floppy and start Bochs:

  $ cd <OBOS sources directory>
  $ dd if=floppy.x86 of=/tmp/obos.img bs=18k
  $ cd /boot/apps/BeBochs1.4
  $ ./bochs

Answer three times with RETURN and with some patience you will see OBOS
booting.
