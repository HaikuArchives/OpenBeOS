From now on any partition mounted usign OpenBFS as the file system
will be set to read/write unless you specifically ask it to be
mounted read-only (using -ro as a parameter for the mount command
line app, for example). This means that it is possible that you 
*LOSE DATA* if you don't mount it as read only.

So far no real write support has ben implemented so you should be ok
for now, but as we work into this code it will become dangerous to
use it unless you know what you're doing. Be warned.
