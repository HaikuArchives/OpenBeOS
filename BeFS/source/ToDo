BFS - ToDo, March 5th, 2002

BlockAllocator

 - the BlockAllocator is very unoptimized and slow, and it doesn't handle
   low on-disk memory well; it just fails instead of providing the requested
   minimum of disk space.
 - the allocation policies are not yet done
 - when they are done, the will have to stand against some real world tests
 - the access to the block bitmap is currently unlocked
 - the updated disk's super block is not written back yet


Queries

 - There shouldn't be any cases where you can speed up a query with reordering
   the query expression - test it
 - Check permissions of the parent directories


Journal

 - The transaction class currently does nothing else than writing the blocks
   directly to disk.


BPlusTree

 - BPlusTree::Remove() currently does not free empty pages


Indices

 - are not yet updated


Volume

 - can't write super block yet (i.e. in bfs_write_fs_stat())
 - needs a lock to protect the super block


... much more stuff for full write capabilities ...
