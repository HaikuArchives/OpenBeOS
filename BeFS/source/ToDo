BFS - ToDo, March 30th, 2002
-----

BlockAllocator

 - the BlockAllocator is only slightly optimized and probably slow
 - the first free and the largest range are currently not correctly maintained (only efficiency suffers - it does work)
 - the allocation policies will have to stand against some real world tests
 - the access to the block bitmap is currently managed using a global lock
 - the updated disk's super block is not written back yet (used block counter)


DataStream

 - shrinking the stream size is not implemented right now
 - growing does only work for the direct range
 - no pre-allocation right now


Queries

 - There shouldn't be any cases where you can speed up a query with reordering
   the query expression - test it
 - Check permissions of the parent directories


Journal

 - The transaction class currently does nothing else than writing the blocks
   directly to disk.


BPlusTree

 - BPlusTree::Remove() currently does not free empty pages
 - CachedNode::Free() could free pages at the end of the stream data

Indices

 - are not yet updated


Volume

 - can't write super block yet (i.e. in bfs_write_fs_stat())
 - needs a lock to protect the super block


... much more stuff for full write capabilities ...
