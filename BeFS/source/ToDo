BFS - ToDo, June 3rd, 2002
-----

BlockAllocator

 - the BlockAllocator is only slightly optimized and probably slow
 - the first free and the largest range are currently not correctly maintained (only efficiency suffers - it does work correctly)
 - the allocation policies will have to stand against some real world tests
 - the access to the block bitmap is currently managed using a global lock


DataStream

 - growing/shrinking the stream size is not implemented for the double indirect range
 - only files are trimmed back (in bfs_close()), but every inode has a preallocated stream...


Queries

 - There shouldn't be any cases where you can speed up a query with reordering the query expression - test it
 - Check permissions of the parent directories
 - Live-Queries aren't implemented yet
 - Add protection against crashing applications which had a query open - at least the original BeOS kernel does not free the cookie (which throws some memory away *and* prevents unmounting the disk)


Journal

 - Check if there are any standard and often-happening cases for a transaction to fail, and if so, start the transaction only when necessary
 - if the system crashes between bfs_unlink() and bfs_remove_vnode(), the inode can be removed from the tree, but its memory is still allocated - this can happen if the inode is still in use by someone (and that's what the "chkbfs" utility is for, mainly).
 - add delayed index updating (+ delete actions to solve the issue above)
 - multiple log files, parallel transactions?
 - variable sized log file
 - as long as we have a fixed-sized log file, it should be possible to reserve space for a transaction to be able to decide if batching it is possible


BPlusTree

 - BPlusTree::Remove() could trigger CachedNode::Free() to go through the free nodes list and free all pages at the end of the data stream
 - updating the TreeIterators doesn't work yet for duplicates (which may be a problem if a duplicate node will go away after a remove)
 - BPlusTree::RemoveDuplicate() could spread the contents of duplicate node with only a few entries to save some space (right now, only empty nodes are freed)


Inode

 - sometimes the inode's last modified time seems to be wrong, and is therefore not found in the b+tree (assuming that the b+tree is working correctly, what I do)


Indices

 - Support for Live-Queries is on the way...


Attributes

 - bfs_write_attr() doesn't check if the attribute data may fit into the small_data region if there already is that attribute as an attribute file


Volume


kernel_interface

 - missing functions, maybe they are not all needed (but most of them are): bfs_rename_attr(), bfs_rename_index(), bfs_initialize(), bfs_sync(), bfs_setflags(), bfs_fsync(), bfs_link()
 - bfs_rename() currently doesn't respect any permissions


general stuff

 - There are also some comments with a leading "ToDo:" directly in the code which may not be mentioned here.
