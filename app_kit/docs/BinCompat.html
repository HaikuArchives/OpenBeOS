<h1>Binary Compatibility in 3 Easy Steps!<hr></h1>

<h2>An Introduction</h2>
In the early days of the OpenBeOS project, a debate raged concerning one of the projects
primary goals: maintaining binary compatibility with BeOS R5.  The idea was that the
only way an effort to rewrite BeOS would be successful was if folks could continue
running the apps they already had.  Certainly, a lot of software available for BeOS is
open source or actively maintained -- these apps could just be recompiled if necessary.
Others -- PostMaster, gobe's Productive suite and a few other crucial apps -- weren't
likely to get rebuilt, either because the original author had stopped maintainance
without being kind enough to release the source, or because it just wouldn't be
commercially feasible.<p>
Some said that we were crazy; that it couldn't be done.  Thankfully, cooler heads
prevailed and we're well on our way to a binary compatible clone of R5.<p>

"But wait!" you cry. "How did the cooler heads which prevailed know that the holy grail
of binary compatibility was achievable?"  I'm so glad you asked!  Keeping reading and be
enlightened, Grasshopper.<p>

<h2>The Issues</h2>
There are three basic issues that have to be addressed to ensure binary compatibility:
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Names must be identical</b><br>
		This includes class and structure names as well as public, protected and global
		function and variable names.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Object sizes must be identical</b><br>
		Classes must contain the same number of bytes of data; global variables must
		be the same size.  Maybe BGlobalVar should've been an <code>int32</code>
		instead of an <code>int16</code>, but we're stuck with it now.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Virtual function table layout must be identical</b><br>
		The most cryptic and confusing aspect of maintaining binary compatibility.
		The issue essentially boils down to this: for any given class, there must
		be the same number of virtual functions, declared in the same order as the
		original.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Nitty Gritty</h2>
"Good grief!" you say. "How on earth do I keep all this stuff straight?"  Ah,
Grasshopper, it is easier that you might imagine.  Just follow these steps, and you
should be binary compatible in no time!
<ol>
	<li>
		<b>Make a copy of the appropriate Be header file</b><br>
		This is now your header file.  You may need to change a thing or two, but what
		you can (or will need to) change is quite limited, and discussed below.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Implement public, protected and virtual functions</b><br>
		In the course of doing this, you may discover that there are some private
		non-virtual function declarations that you just don't use.  Feel free to axe
		them!  Since they're private, nobody using the class will miss them, and
		because they're not virtual, they don't effect the vtable layout.  Conversely,
		if you find a need to add some private, non-virtual functions, go right ahead
		(for the very same reasons).
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Make sure you don't change the number of bytes used for data</b><br>
		There are two situations that can make this seem difficult.  First, there
		may be data members that you don't use in your reimplementation.  You can
		just leave them (safe, but a little messy) or you can add the extra members'
		bytes to the class's "unused" data array.  An example will make this clear.<br>
		Let's say we have a class BFoo:<br>
		<code>
		<pre>
	class BFoo {
	    public:
	        BFoo();
	        void SomeFunc();
	    private:
	        int32 fBar;
	        char  fZig;
	        int32 fQux;
	        int32 fUnused[2];
	};
		</pre>
		</code>
		The Be engineers that originally wrote this BFoo purposely added some data
		padding in the form of an array of 2 <code>int32</code>s (they did this with
		most classes in the API).  Now let's suppose in your implementation, you
		really didn't need <code>fQux</code>.  You can add <code>fQux</code>'s bytes
		into <code>fUnused</code>:<br>
		<code>
		<pre>
	class BFoo
	{
	    ...
	    private:
	        int32 fBar;
	        char  fZig;
	        int32 fUnused[3];
	};
		</pre>
		</code>
		Nothing could be easier! An additional twist that should be noted is that
		data member order must also be preserved.  In much the same way as existing
		apps will "look" for virtual functions in a specific place in the vtable,
		so will they "look" for data members in a specific place in an object.<br>
		"But what if I don't need <code>fZig</code>, either?" you wonder. "It's only
		one byte, not four like an <code>int32</code>!"  Have no fear!  Just rename it
		"<code>fUnusedChar</code>" and be done with it.<p>

		The second situation that can make preserving object size tricky is if there
		aren't <i>enough</i> bytes of data available.  Building on our cheesy BFoo
		example, let's suppose that rather than getting rid of <code>fQux</code> and
		<code>fZig</code>, you actually needed to <i>add</i> another 4
		<code>int32</code>s worth of data: <code>fNewData1</code> through
		<code>fNewData4</code>.  The original implementation of BFoo has two extra
		<code>int32</code>s which we can use, but that leaves us two <code>int32</code>s
		short.  What to do?  The easiest thing to do is create a data structure to hold
		your new data and convert one of the <code>fUnused</code> items into a pointer
		to that structure:
		<code>
		<pre>
	// Foo.h
	struct _BFooData_;
	class BFoo
	{
	    public:
	        BFoo();
	        ~BFoo();
	        void SomeFunc();
	    private:
	       int32 fBar;
	       char  fZig;
	       _BFooData_* fNewData;
	       int32 fUnused[1];
	};

	// Foo.cpp
	struct _BFooData_
	{
		int32 fNewData1;
		int32 fNewData2;
		int32 fNewData3;
		int32 fNewData4;
	};
	BFoo::BFoo()
	{
		fNewData = new _BFooData_;
	}
	BFoo::~BFoo()
	{
		delete fNewData;
	}
		</pre>
		</code>
		Voila!  More data without making the class bigger.  Notice the added
		destructor; make sure you're cleaning up your new (dynamically allocated) data.
	</li>
</ol>
