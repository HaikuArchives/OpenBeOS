<h1>Interface Kit Team Schedule<hr></h1>
<p>
Here is the schedule for the Interface Kit Team.  To help organize our work,
tasks have been broken into 4 general areas:
<ul>
<scripting>
@for_each group in $GROUPS
	<li><a href="$group.short_name/$group.short_name##Milestones.html">$group.name</a>$group.note</li>
@end
</scripting>
</ul>
</p><p>
Organizationally, it's best to consider these as separate projects within the
scope of the IK Team's charter.  As such, core contributors should pick a
project and stick with it -- it will make things a lot easier to keep track of,
and losing track of stuff would be a bad thing. =)
</p><p>
DarkWyrm is the technical lead for the app_server; he has done an enormous amount
of research and he is currently in the best position to lead the effort.
</p><p>
Erik Jakowatz will continue in his capacity as overall project lead, as well as
being directly involved in Integration as technical lead.
</p><p>
A word of warning:  this schedule is downright huge because of the sheer number of
items to be completed.  There is a paper available in which the rationale behind the
schedule is <a href="Discussion.html">discussed</a>.

Here are some fuzzy indicators of what progress the team has made base on the number of
outstanding tasks completed.  No warranty is made concerning the accuracy of these
graphs. =)
