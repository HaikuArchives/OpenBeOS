/*
	$Id$
	
	This file implements a test class for testing BLocker functionality.
	It tests use cases "Destruction" and "Locking 3".
	
	The test works like the following:
		- the main thread acquires the lock
		- the second thread sleeps
		- the second thread then attempts to acquire the lock
		- the first thread releases the lock
		- at this time, the new thread acquires the lock and goes to sleep
		- the first thread attempts to acquire the lock
		- the second thread deletes the lock
		- the first thread is woken up indicating that the lock wasn't acquired.
