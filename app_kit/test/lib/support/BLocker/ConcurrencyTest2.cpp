	This file implements a test class for testing BLocker functionality.
	It tests use cases "Locking 1", "Locking 2", "Unlocking", "Is Locked",
	"Locking Thread" and "Count Locks".  It is essentially the same as Test1.cpp
	except it makes the first LockWithTimeout inside the threads timeout.  The
	reason for this is because the implementation of BLocker by Be and with OpenBeOS
	is such that after one timeout occurs on a benaphore style BLocker, the lock
	effectively becomes a semaphore style BLocker.  This test tests that condition.
