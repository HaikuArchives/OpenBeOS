/*

	This file implements a test class for testing BMessageQueue functionality.
	It tests use cases Destruction, Add Message 3, Remove Message 2,
	Next Message 2, Lock 1, Lock 2, Unlock.
	
	The test works like the following:
		- It does the test two times, one unlocking using Unlock() and the other
		  unlocking using delete.
		- It populates the queue with numAddMessages messages to start.
		- The queue is locked
	    - It starts four threads.
	    - In one thread, a NextMessage() blocks
	    - In the second thread, a RemoveMessage() blocks
	    - In the third thread, an AddMessage() blocks
	    - In the fourth thread, a Lock() blocks
	    - After a short snooze, the queue is released using Unlock() or delete.
	    - Each of the four threads wake up and each checks as best it can that it
	      was successful and did not violate mutual exclusion.
