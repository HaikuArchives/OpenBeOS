// Data Member Documentation:
//
// The "fBenaphoreCount" member is set to 1 if the BLocker style is
// semaphore.  If the style is benaphore, it is initialized to 0 and
// is incremented atomically when it is acquired, decremented when it
// is released.  By setting the benaphore count to 1 when the style is
// semaphore, the benaphore effectively becomes a semaphore.  I was able
// to determine this is what Be's implementation does by testing the
// result of the CountLockRequests() member.
//
// The "fSemaphoreID" member holds the sem_id returned from create_sem()
// when the BLocker is constructed.  It is used to acquire and release
// the lock regardless of the lock style (semaphore or benaphore).
//
// The "fLockOwner" member holds the thread_id of the thread which
// currently holds the lock.  If no thread holds the lock, it is set to
// B_ERROR.
//
// The "fRecursiveCount" member holds a count of the number of times the
// thread holding the lock has acquired the lock without a matching unlock.
// It is basically the number of times the thread must call Unlock() before
// the lock can be acquired by a different thread.
//


//
// Constructors:
//
// All constructors just pass their arguments to InitLocker().  Note that
// the default for "name" is "some BLocker" and "benaphore_style" is true.

   			// changes to semaphore style if this was a benaphore.
   			//
   			// Doing the decrement of the benaphore count when the acquisition
   			// fails is a risky thing to do.  If you decrement the counter at
   			// the same time the thread which holds the benaphore does an
   			// Unlock(), there is serious risk of a race condition.
   			//
   			// If the Unlock() sees a positive count and releases the semaphore
   			// and then the timed out thread decrements the count to 0, there
   			// is no one to take the semaphore.  The next two threads will be
   			// able to acquire the benaphore at the same time!  The first will
   			// increment the counter and acquire the lock.  The second will
   			// acquire the semaphore and therefore the lock.  Not good.
   			//
   			// This has been discussed on the becodetalk mailing list and
   			// Trey from Be had this to say:
   			//
   			// I looked at the LockWithTimeout() code, and it does not have
   			// _this_ (ie the race condition) problem.  It circumvents it by
   			// NOT doing the atomic_add(&count, -1) if the semaphore
   			// acquisition fails.  This means that if a
   			// BLocker::LockWithTimeout() times out, all other Lock*() attempts
   			// turn into guaranteed semaphore grabs, _with_ the overhead of a
   			// (now) useless atomic_add().
   			//
   			// Given Trey's comments, it looks like Be took the same approach
   			// I did.  The output of CountLockRequests() of Be's implementation
   			// confirms Trey's comments also.
   			//
   			// Finally some thoughts for the future with this code:
   			//   - If 2^31 timeouts occur on a 32-bit machine (ie today),
   			//     the benaphore count will wrap to a negative number.  This
   			//     would have unknown consequences on the ability of the BLocker
   			//     to continue to function.
   			//
