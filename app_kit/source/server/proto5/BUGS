Redraw code needs work.

When moving a window, if the mouse somehow gets outside the window's frame, it stops moving. Need a better input handling system for move/resize

Server needs to set a cursor at startup

Get a General OS Error followed by a segfault only when an application is started and the server is running under the debugger.

Cursor display is just a little bit funky (try moving cursor by 1 pixel) when using the ViewDriver
