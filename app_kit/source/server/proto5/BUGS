Server needs to set a cursor at startup

MoveToFront and MoveToBack code in WindowBorder needs fixed

Get a General OS Error followed by a segfault only when an application is started and the server is running under the debugger.

Cursor display is just a little bit funky (try moving cursor by 1 pixel) when using the ViewDriver
