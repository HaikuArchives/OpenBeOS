  and allows to abort it
- pdf generation
  - implement the remaining graphic primitives
  - alpha channel support
  - patterns
  - clip to stroke graphic primitives has no equivalent in PDF
    (clip to StrokeShape, StrokeRect, ...)
  - embed font with different encodings only once
  - text attributes
  - check: char spacing
- fix crashing bug: when file dialog is canceled

- security settings (printing, copying, changing, ...)
- password protection
