Description
-----------
Welcome to stubgen version 2.05 (build 1086).

stubgen is a C++ development tool that keeps code files in sync with
their associated headers.  When it finds a member function declaration
in a header file that doesn't have a corresponding implementation, it
creates an empty skeleton with descriptive comment headers.  stubgen has
several options, but see the "Brief Example" section below for an idea
of what it can do.

Brief Example
-------------
Suppose you have the following header file Point.h:
 
          class Point {
          public:
              Point(int x, int y);
              void addTo(const Point& other);
 
              int xValue, yValue;
          };
 
Running "stubgen -s Point.h" would produce the following file:
 
          /***********************************************
           * AUTHOR: Michael John Radwin <mjr@acm.org>
           *   FILE: Point.cpp

           *  DESCR:
           ***********************************************/
          #include "Point.h"
 
          /*
           *  Method: Point::Point()
           *   Descr:
           */
          Point::Point(int x, int y)
          {
          }
 
          /*
           *  Method: Point::addTo()
           *   Descr:
           */
          void
          Point::addTo(const Point& other)
          {
          }


Supported Platforms
-------------------
I've successfully built stubgen on the following platforms, using the
GNU tools make, gcc, bison, and flex:

    SPARC Solaris (2.5 and 2.6)
    SunOS 4.1.3
    SGI IRIX 5.3
    RS6000 AIX 3.2
    MS Windows NT 4.0 (using GNU bison/flex and MSVC++ 5.0)

Building
--------
1. ensure that your system has 'flex' installed.
2. ensure that your system has 'yacc', 'byacc', or 'bison' installed.
3. edit 'Makefile' and pick your favorite CC, LEX, YACC, LFLAGS and CFLAGS
4. run 'make'

We assume that flex, bison, and cc/gcc are in your path.

For win32, there's no need to build.  You'll find stubgen.exe in the
directory .\win32.


Installing
----------
There is no fancy installation procedure.  Since the binary doesn't
depend on any other files, copy it to /usr/local/bin or wherever you
choose.  You may wish to copy stubgen.1 to /usr/local/man/man1 or some
similar directory.
