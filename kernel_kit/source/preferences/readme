Introduction
It's just a copy of the virtual memory preferences app that comes with BeOS.  Except it doesn't work: once Open BeOS gets along a little farther, and I've learned how, it will actually set the swap file size, etc.  Until then, it's just eye candy.

Documentation
Even tho it wasn't really necessary, I know I've overdocumented this app,  My excuse is that I wanted to learn how to use doxygen, and this was a good app to run it on.  So if you want full documentation, and you have doxygen installed, available from BeBits, run 
doxygen .doxygen-conf
in the code directory, and it will create docs for you, in code/docs.
