	This directory is full of old doxygen generated stuff that I shortly
	realized was not necessary to include in CVS. If you're interested in
	the Storage Kit documentation, download doxygen from BeBits.com and
	run it in storage_kit/docs (i.e. doxygen doxygen_config). That'll
	generate an up to date storage_kit/docs/html/ folder for you. :-)
