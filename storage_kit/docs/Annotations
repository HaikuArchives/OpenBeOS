Module:      BEntry
Location:    BEntry(const BDirectory*, const char*),
             SetTo(const BDirectory*, const char*)
Description: Crash when passing a NULL BDirectory.


OS:          BeOS R5
Module:      BEntry
Location:    MoveTo()
Description: Crashs when passing a NULL BDirectory.


OS:          BeOS R5
Module:      BPath
Location:    BPath(const BDirectory*, const char*, bool),
             SetTo(const BDirectory*, const char*, bool)
Description: Crash when passing a NULL BDirectory.


OS:          BeOS R5
Module:      BPath
Location:    GetParent()
Description: Crashs when called on an uninitialized object or when passing
             a NULL BPath.


OS:          BeOS R5
Module:      BPath
Location:    operator==(), operator!=()
Description: Uninitialized paths are not equal. An initialized path equals
             a (const char*)NULL, an uninitialized path does not.


OS:          BeOS R5
Module:      BPath
Location:    Flatten()
Description: Crashs when passing a NULL buffer and doesn't check the buffer
             size.


OS:          BeOS R5
Module:      BStatable
Location:    destructor
Description: Is not virtual.


OS:          BeOS R5
Module:      BStatable
Location:    GetAccessTime(), SetAccessTime()
Description: Access time unused.


OS:          BeOS R5
Module:      BStatable
Location:    GetPermissions()
Description: Doesn't filter the mode flags, thus not only the permissions are
             returned.


OS:          BeOS R5
Module:      BStatable
Location:    Get*()
Description: Crash when passing a NULL pointer.


OS:          OBOS POSIX
Module:      BStatable
Location:    SetPermissions/ModificationTime/CreationTime()
Description: Don't work due to set_stat(FileDescriptor, StatMember)
             limitations.


OS:          OBOS POSIX
Module:      kernel_interface
Location:    set_stat(FileDescriptor, StatMember)
Description: WSTAT_MODE, WSTAT_*TIME can't be implemented due to missing
             fchmod()/FD time setters.


OS:          BeOS R5
Module:      libroot
Location:    fchown()
Description: fchown(file, 0xFFFFFFFF, gid) sets the UID to 0xFFFFFFFF, which
             is a bug.


OS:          BeOS R5
Module:      libroot
Location:    readdir(), fs_read_attr_dir()
Description: The d_reclen field of a dirent structure does not contain the
             length of the whole structure (unlike stated in
             BeBook::BEntryList), but only the length of the d_name field.
             If the terminating '\0' is counted or not seems to depend on the
             file system.


OS:          OBOS POSIX
Module:      kernel_interface
Location:    read_link(FileDescriptor, char*, size_t)
Description: Can't be implemented due to the lack of an FD readlink() version.


OS:          BeOS R5
Module:      BSymLink
Location:    MakeLinkedPath(const char*, BPath*)
Description: The dirPath seems to be converted into a BDirectory, which
             causes links to be resolved, i.e. a "/tmp" dirPath expands to
             "/boot/var/tmp". That does also mean, that the dirPath must
             exists!


OS:          BeOS R5
Module:      BSymLink
Location:    MakeLinkedPath()
Description: Crashs when passing a NULL const char* or BDirectory.
