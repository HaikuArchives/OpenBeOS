Notes concerning the OpenBeOS implementation of BNode:
1. GetNextAttrName returns B_BAD_VALUE when passed a NULL pointer instead of crashing
2. R5::BNode returns B_BAD_ADDRESS when RewindAttrs() fails (not B_FILE_ERROR as claimed in the BeBook). We currently follow suit.
3. RenameAttr() actually works, whereas the R5 version doesn't (apparently because BFS doesn't implement it directly...).
4. Write/ReadAttrString() functions need to be documented (they aren't in the R5 BeBook).
5. ReadAttrString() adds an extra NULL char to the end of the string it reads as a precaution.
6. Write/ReadAttrString() can't be tested until we have an OpenBeOS implementation of BString.
