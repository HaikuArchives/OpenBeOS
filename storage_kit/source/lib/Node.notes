Notes concerning the OpenBeOS implementation of BNode:
1. GetNextAttrName returns B_BAD_VALUE when passed a NULL pointer instead of crashing
2. R5::BNode returns B_BAD_ADDRESS when RewindAttrs() fails (not B_FILE_ERROR as claimed in the BeBook). We currently follow suit.
3. RenameAttr() actually works, whereas the R5 version doesn't (apparently because BFS doesn't implement it directly...).
