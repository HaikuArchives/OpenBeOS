# NOTE: This line makes the compiler use our OpenBeOS headers
#		when compiling Test.StorageKit.cpp; that means they *must*
#		be compatible with the R5 libraries, because for
#		Test.StorageKit.R5, we're linking in R5 libraries to
# 		a program compiled using our headers. Shouldn't be
# 		a problem since we're going for source compatibility
#		anyway, but I thought I'd mention it. There ought to
#		be a way to compile Test.StorageKit.cpp to two different
#		object files using two different sets of headers (ours
#		and Be's), but I haven't dug one up yet... :-)
