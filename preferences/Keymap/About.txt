OpenBeOS Keymap preferences

2002-05-16 - The input_server is restarted when a keymap is 'use'd. Hooray!

2002-05-11 - Ok, I have found the 'move keys around with the right mouse button' feature. Now I see  the Revert button make sense. Sorry I doubted you JLG :)

2002-05-08 - Fixed switching from user- to system maps and vice versa and added revert button. Just like the original, it does abolutely nothing. Makes one wonder why it is there in the first place.

2002-02-16 - Moved message definitions to messages.h, chopped KeymapApplication::UseKeymap into smaller pieces, created member variable fApplication in KeymapWindow, applied OpenTracker guidelines

2002-02-15 - Added resource file and 'Use' button, made 'System' and 'User' lists mutually exclusive and implemented keymap file copying

2002-02-09 - Added resource file and 'Use' button and made 'System' and 'User' lists mutually exclusive - sort of

2002-02-08 - Initial checkin


This version:
Copies keymap files but doesn't do much else - you even have to restart the Input Server (try BeReset for that) for the new keymap to work. It seems bugfree at doing what it does though :)


To do (likely in this order):
- somehow inform Input Server to use the newly chosen keymap, or else restart the Input Server
- preselect 'Current'
- make the 'System' and 'User' labels show up (or: why are they invisible in the current version?)
- layout the sources to conform to OBOS standards
- find Be-defined constants for paths and/or files
- check validity of keymap file before copying
- add all the fancy stuff that's in the original Keymap application
- switch to Jam
- get rid of all excess symbols (or: what linker switch makes the linker remove all external symbols?)
- hunt leaks and fix'em


If anyone looks at my code and sees any major problems, please email me to tell me, I want to work hard on this app to make sure it's as stable and complete as it can get for the OpenBeOS project.
