OpenBeOS Keymap preferences

2002-02-08 - initial checkin

This version:
It is close to basic functionality. Needs a little work though, and maybe some restructuring. See To do list.

To do:
- make selecting system and user maps mutually exclusive
- implement Use button
- implement Revert button
- make the 'System' and 'User' labels show up (or: why are they invisible in the current version?)
- layout the sources to conform to OBOS standards
- add all the fancy stuff that's in the original Keymap application
- move to Jam
- get rid of all excess symbols (or: why is there >500kB worth of symbols in the executable that aren't in Be's?)


If anyone looks at my code and sees any major problems, please email me to tell me, I want to work hard on this app to make sure it's as stable and complete as it can get for the OpenBeOS project.
