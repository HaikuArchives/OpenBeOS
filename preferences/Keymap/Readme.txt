OpenBeOS Keymap preferences

2002-02-09 - Added resource file and 'Use' button and made 'System' and 'User' lists mutually exclusive

This version:
It is close to basic functionality. Needs a little work though, and maybe some restructuring. See To do list.

To do:
- implement Use button
- fix map selection
- implement Revert button
- move message definitions to messages.h
- make the 'System' and 'User' labels show up (or: why are they invisible in the current version?)
- layout the sources to conform to OBOS standards
- add all the fancy stuff that's in the original Keymap application
- switch to Jam
- get rid of all excess symbols (or: what linker switch makes the linker remove all external symbols?)
- hunt leaks and fix'em


If anyone looks at my code and sees any major problems, please email me to tell me, I want to work hard on this app to make sure it's as stable and complete as it can get for the OpenBeOS project.
