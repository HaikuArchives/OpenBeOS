<H1>BLocker Use Cases and Implementation Details:</H1>

<P>This document describes the BLocker interface and some basics of how it is implemented.
The document has the following sections:</P>

<A NAME="interface"></A><H2>BLocker Interface:</H2>

<P>The BLocker class is a simple class for handling synchronization between threads.  The best
source of information for the BLocker interface can be found
<A HREF="file:///boot/beos/documentation/Be%20Book/The%20Support%20Kit/Locker.html">here in the Be Book</A>.
</P>

<A NAME="usecases"></A><H2>BLocker Use Cases:</H2>

<P>The following use cases cover the BLocker functionality:</P>

<OL>
<LI><P><B>Construction 1:</B> A BLocker can be created by specifying a name for the semaphore used
internally.  If a name is specified during construction, then that name is given to the internal
semaphore.  If no name is given at construction, the semaphore is given the name "some BLocker".
</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Construction 2:</B> A BLocker can use a semaphore or a "benaphore" internally depending
on a flag passed when the BLocker is created.  If the flag is false, the BLocker uses a semaphore
to do synchronization.  If the flag is true, the BLocker uses a benaphore internally to do
synchronization.  If no flag is specified, the BLocker uses a benaphore internally.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Destruction:</B> When a BLocker is destructed, any threads waiting for the lock are
immediately unblocked.  The threads are notified by the return code of the locking member function
that the lock was not successfully acquired.  Any threads blocked on Lock() will return with
a false value.  Any threads blocked on LockWithTimeout() will return with B_BAD_SEM_ID.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Locking 1:</B> When a thread acquires the BLocker using the Lock() or LockWithTimeout()
member functions, no other thread can acquire the lock until this thread releases it.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Locking 2:</B> When a thread holds the BLocker and it calls Lock() or LockWithTimeout(),
the member function returns immediately.  The thread must call Unlock() the same number of times
it calls Lock...() before the BLocker is released.  At any time, the thread can call CountLocks()
to get the number of times it must call Unlock() to release the BLocker.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Locking 3:</B> When a thread calls Lock(), the thread blocks until it can acquire the
lock.  Once the lock has been acquired or an unrecoverable error has occurred, the Lock() member
function completes.  If the lock has been acquired, Lock() returns true.  If the lock has not
been acquired, Lock() returns false.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Locking 4:</B> When a thread calls LockWithTimeout(), the thread blocks until it can
acquire the lock, the time specified in microseconds expires, or an unrecoverable error occurs.
If the timeout specified is B_INFINTE_TIMEOUT, there is no timeout and the member function will
either acquire the lock or fail due to an unrecoverable error.  If the lock is acquired, the
member function returns B_OK.  If the timeout is reached, B_TIMED_OUT is returned and the lock is
not acquired.  If a serious error occurs, a non B_OK code is returned.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Unlocking:</B> The Unlock() member function takes no arguments and returns no value.
If the thread currently holds the lock, the lock count is reduced by the call to Unlock().  If
the lock count reaches zero, then another thread may acquire the lock.  If the thread does not
hold the lock and it calls Unlock(), the call will have no affect at all on the BLocker.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Locking Thread:</B> The LockingThread() member function returns the thread_id of the
thread that is holding the lock.  If no thread holds the lock, then B_ERROR is returned.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Is Locked:</B> The IsLocked() member function returns true if the BLocker is currently
held by the calling thread.  If the BLocker is not acquired by any thread or it is acquired by a
different thread, IsLocked() returns false.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Count Locks:</B> The CountLocks() member function returns the number of times the lock
has been acquired by the thread which holds the lock.  If no thread holds the lock, then 0 is
returned.  If the BLocker is held by any thread, including a thread which is not the thread
making the CountLocks() request, the number of times the lock has been acquired by the thread which
holds the lock is returned.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Count Lock Requests:</B> The CountLockRequests() member function returns the number of
threads currently attempting to lock the BLocker.  If no thread holds the lock and no thread is
waiting for the lock, then 0 is returned.  If one thread holds the lock and no other threads
are waiting for the lock, then 1 is returned.  If one thread holds the lock and x threads are
waiting for the lock, then x+1 is returned.  The call to CountLockRequests() can be made by any
thread including threads which do not have the lock.</P>

<P><B>NOTE:</B> Reading the Be Book, that would seem like what is returned by this member
function.  In actuality, the value returned is just the "benaphore count" for the BLocker.
If the BLocker is semaphore style, then the benaphore count is set to 1 at construction time
to ensure that the semaphore is always tested when a lock is acquired.  The return value is
just this count.  So, the return value for benaphore style is:</P>

<PRE>
numThreadsWaitingForTheLock + numThreadsHoldingTheLock + numOfTimeoutsOccuredOnTheLock
</PRE>

<P>The return value for a semaphore style is:</P>

<PRE>
numThreadsWaitingForTheLock + numThreadsHoldingTheLock + numOfTimeoutsOccuredOnTheLock + 1
</PRE>

<P>Again, this is what we are implementing but the above description is what appears in the
BeBook as far as I understand it.</P>
</LI>

<LI><P><B>Sem:</B> The Sem() member function returns the sem_id of the semaphore used by the
BLocker.  If the BLocker is a benaphore, then the sem_id returned is the semaphore used to
implement the benaphore.  If the BLocker is a not a benaphore, then the sem_id returned is the
semaphore which the BLocker represents.</P></LI>
