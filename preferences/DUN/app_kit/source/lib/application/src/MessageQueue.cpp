 *          BLocker from the destructor once it is acquired. That way, any thread
 *          waiting to do a AddMessage() will fail to acquire the lock since the

 *               true.  The same assumption is made with Be's implementation.
 *             - The BMessage is not already on this or any other BMessageQueue.
 *               If it is, the queue it is already on will be corrupted.  Be's
