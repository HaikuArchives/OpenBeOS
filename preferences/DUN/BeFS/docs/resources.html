<H1>Hints for BeOS File System Authors</H1>

<P>Besides the example DOS file system that comes with the BeOS developers
stuff, there's also a CD-ROM file system example.  If you installed the
optional stuff on the BeOS 5.0 Pro CD-ROM (or the developer's kit from the free
site), it's at: /boot/optional/sample-code/add-ons/iso9660

<P>On <A HREF="http://www.bebits.com/">BeBits</A> you can get source code
examples from a few programs, such as AtheOS FS (<A
HREF="http://www.bebits.com/app/2028">app 2028 on BeBits</A>).  There used to
be a copy of NTFS too with source (<A HREF="http://www.bebits.com/app/620">app
620 on BeBits</A>), but the site seems to be down.  There are also other file
systems there, but source is not included (some have it available on request).

<P>Another useful source of information is the <A
HREF="http://www.be.com/developers/dev_lib/index.html">BeOS developer library
web site</A>.  It has some articles on file systems, the most relevant being
the <A
HREF="http://www-classic.be.com/aboutbe/benewsletter/volume_III/Issue20.html#Insight">One
File Network File System</A>, which shows one way of combining a user space
program with a kernel file system stub.  Another good one is <A
HREF="http://www-classic.be.com/aboutbe/benewsletter/Issue52.html#Insight">about
the FSP</A> (file system protocol).  The prior issue describes what <A
HREF="http://www-classic.be.com/aboutbe/benewsletter/Issue51.html#Insight">features
the BFS supports</A>.  There are lots of other tangentially related articles,
such as ones on device drivers, programming in kernel mode, debugging, etc.

<P>There's also the very good <CITE>Practical File System Design</CITE> book
by Dominic Giampaolo, from <A HREF="http://www.mkp.com/">Morgan Kaufmann
Publishers</A>, read their <A
HREF="http://www.mkp.com/books_catalog/catalog.asp?ISBN=1-55860-497-9">catalog
entry</A> for more info about the book.

<P>Finally, there's <A
HREF="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Alexander+G.+M.+Smith%22">Alexander G.
M. Smith</A>'s ongoing documentation of the file system API, condensed from all
these sources and from his continuing experiences with trying to write a RAM
file system.  You can get the StyledEdit text file with the <A
HREF="http://www.achilles.net/~agmsmith/beos/FileSystemAPINotes20011018.zip">October
18 2001 version</A> or check the <A
HREF="http://www.achilles.net/~agmsmith/beos/">BeOS directory</A> on his site
for newer versions.
