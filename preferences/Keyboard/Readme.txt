OpenBeOS Keyboard Preferences

To Do:

Add Icons of the key and clock.
Deal with preference file.
Font sensitivity (Delayed till R2)
Notify input_server of any updates.
Change to make or Jam
...Probably loads of other stuff too!

If anyone looks at my code and see's any major problems, please email me to tell me, I want to work hard on this app to make sure its as stable, and complete as it can get for the OpenBeOS project.
