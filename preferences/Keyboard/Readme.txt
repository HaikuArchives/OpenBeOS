OpenBeOS Keyboard Preferences

31/1/2002 - Beta 1 Released.

To Do:

Add Icons of the key and clock.
Font sensitivity (Delayed till R2)
Change to make or Jam
When creating the initial window, if its not in the screen's co-ords, stick it in the middle of the screen.
Bring a load of objects into the private section and create accessor functions for the things I need.
...Probably loads of other stuff too!

If anyone looks at my code and see's any major problems, please email me to tell me, I want to work hard on this app to make sure its as stable, and complete as it can get for the OpenBeOS project.
