OpenBeOS Keyboard Preferences

15/02/2002 - Beta 2.0.1 Released.

Fixed a problem if the program is being run and there isn't a /boot/home/config/settings/Keyboard_Settings file already in place.

Bug #517797

02/02/2002 - Beta 2 Released.

This version:

Moved objects to private section of classes and created accessor methods.
Changed some messaging to read the data out of the message rather than going
back to the object for the information.
Added the icons.
Added an AboutRequested
If the initial co-ords are off screen, the application is now drawn in the middle of the screen.

To Do:

Font sensitivity (Delayed till R2)
Change to make or Jam
...Probably loads of other stuff too!

This application is pretty much finished now, and really needs a good beta testing to try and spot bugs.

If anyone looks at my code and see's any major problems, please email me to tell me, I want to work hard on this app to make sure its as stable, and complete as it can get for the OpenBeOS project.
