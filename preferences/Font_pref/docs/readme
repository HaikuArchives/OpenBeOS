Font Pref App

ISSUES

* Rescanning fonts causes the bold font to lose its boldness.
* Fixed width font selector should only show fixed width fonts

TODO

* When a style is selected, the font menu label needs to be updated to reflect this
* make a cache panel function that updates the slider labels with an int as a parameter
* Add the VMSettings code so that the panel uses the settings file for position/size
