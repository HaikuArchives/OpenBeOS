OpenBeOS Mouse Preferences

To Do:

All the file IO is in place.
The messaging loops are there.

Just need to create the GUI and hook it up to the backend.

If anyone looks at my code and see's any major problems, please email me to tell me, I want to work hard on this app to make sure its as stable, and complete as it can get for the OpenBeOS project.
