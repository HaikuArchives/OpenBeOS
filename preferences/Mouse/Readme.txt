OpenBeOS Mouse Preferences

09/02/2002

Changed the code to conform with the OpenTracker Style Guidelines
Changed the code to work with make

01/02/2002

All the file IO is in place
The messaging loops are there
Move over to make or Jam
Just need to create the GUI and hook it up to the backend
The "Mouse" image needs to be put in

If anyone looks at my code and see's any major problems, please email me to tell me, I want to work hard on this app to make sure its as stable, and complete as it can get for the OpenBeOS project.
