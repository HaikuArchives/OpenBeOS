OpenBeOS Screen Preferences by Rafael Romo, rockman@tiscali.it

Readme

The Screen preferences app is a big one and it has a lot of hidden features that many BeOS users don't know.
This version has all of them except command line support and keyboard support (shortcuts).
The app is not a true copy of the original and it sets display modes in a , maybe more secure, way.
However, be careful using this program: it has been tested with a 17" monitor only.

Special thanks
