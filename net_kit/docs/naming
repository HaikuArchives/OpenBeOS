Document naming.

Well, I've been thinking about this and I've decided that maybe 
this formatting of the numbers we use will work. Maybe it won't, 
but until someone else shouts...

First digit is the milestone referred to, with 0 being for
general design.

Second digit:
	- layer involved for general design
	- incremental for milestones
	- 0 for general design comments

So, 	00 = general design principals
	01 = general design for layer 1
	10 = general design comments for milestone 1
	11 = first document about milestone 1

Does that work for people?
