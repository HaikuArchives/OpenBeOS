Net Cache - Milestone #2
========================

Hmm, a general purpose net cache.

Types of Cache
==============

What are we likely to need a fast cache for?  Look below.

- ipv4 address to ethernet MAC address (ARP)
- MAC address to IPv4 (RARP)
- list of IPv6 neighbours/routers/prefix's

There remain problems in that for many of these needs additional
information is required, this information being specific to the
use at the time.

However, all these uses require an ability to quickly find information
given a key that is a number of variable length, hence the conceptual
idea of using a hash lookup.
