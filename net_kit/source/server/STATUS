Questions for discussion.

-  do we want a CHANGES file as well?

-  should the ethernet_input function be called from the rx_thread with the buffer
   and then strip the ethernet header while creating the mbuf to pass into the chain?
   This removes one issue with the "upper" protocols and is closer to what a conventional
   BSD stack would do.

   One thng that remains uncertain is how we'd manage the different function declarations
   in the structure. Do we really want to add another input with different paramters that
   will only be used by one module?

To Do Items

-  the input functions should take the length of the headers read in the previous
   protocol as a second paramter. Most protocols have variable length headers, which is
   why this is neccesary.
